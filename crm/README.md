# Overview

This Django app is a simple CRM system. After creating an account, you are redirected to a home page, where you can see the current customers and their orders. You can see the status of the order and update the status of the order. Once inside the customer page, you can filter the orders by name, status or date created.

# Web Pages

The main pages in the app are the registration page, login page, home page, customer page and Order Form page.
Once you register, you are redirected to the home page, dynamically. Same thing when you login.
Inside the home page you can either go to each specific customer detailed page or you can update or delete any order.
Inside the customer page, you can make a new order, update the customer and filter to see what the customer has already ordered.
